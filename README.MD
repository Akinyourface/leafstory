This is an RPG like Engine created in Python and Pygame.
Tiled support is added using an api called PyTMX.
Artwork used in this prototype is opensource, and the music was composed by me.

This project is merely an attempt on how an RPG rogue like dungeon crawler works
mechanically, and a way to showcase my programming, and problem solving skills.
I've rewritten it several times, and I have some of my earlier prototypes already
posted on my github account.

Some of the things I want to accomplish in this project;

1. Correct camera movement [complete]
2. Inventory System [uncomplete]
3. NPC's and dialogue boxes [uncomplete]
4. Drawing of different layers, and loading different tilemaps [complete]
